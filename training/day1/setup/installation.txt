installing nginx:
    1. Install Homebrew and Homebrew Cask
        a. xcode-select --install
        b. ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        c. brew doctor
    2. brew install nginx
    3. After install run:
            sudo nginx
        Testing Open Navigator it by going to URL:
            http://localhost:8080
    4. Configuration
        The default place of nginx.conf on Mac after installing with brew is:
            /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        Changing the default port (8080). We shall change it to 80. 
    5. First stop the nginx server if it is running by: 
            sudo nginx -s stop
    6. Then open nginx.conf with (example vim):
            vim /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
            and change the:

 server {
listen       8080;
server_name  localhost;

#access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

location / {
    root   html;
    index  index.html index.htm;
}
to:

server {
listen       80;
server_name  localhost;

#access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

location / {
    root   html;
    index  index.html index.htm;
}
Save configuration and relaunch nginx

sudo nginx
Testing

Open Navigator it by going to URL:

http://localhost
Update: thanks @pablohenrique 
* ERROR 403 Forbidden - *
dont worry, some other application is already using port 80. probably be skype.

1 Solution 1: Change Skype port in Skype > Preferences > advanced
2 Solution 2: No change server { listen to 80.

That means that nginx will use port 8080 instead of 80. To access it I would use this url
http://localhost:8080.

Changing the path of defualt web location

he nginx html folder (brew install only) is by the defult in:

/usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.2.3/html
Note: change ** 1.2.3 ** to your nginx version.

The defualt path configuration:

server {
listen       80;
server_name  localhost;

#access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

location / {
    root   html;
    index  index.html index.htm;
}
To let say Users/to/www:

 server {
listen       80;
server_name  localhost;

#access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

location / {
    root   /Users/to/www;
    index  index.html index.htm;
}
