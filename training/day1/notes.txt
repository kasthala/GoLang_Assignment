history:
Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.[23] The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics:[24]

Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C++)
Readability and usability (like Python or JavaScript)[25]
High-performance networking and multiprocessing
The designers were primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++.[26][27][28]

Go was publicly announced in November 2009,[29] and version 1.0 was released in March 2012.[30][31] Go is widely used in production at Google[32] and in many other organizations and open-source projects.


Gopher mascot
In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts which are sans-serif and monospaced respectively were released by type designers Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes. Both were designed to be legible with a large x-height, distinct letterforms and conformity to DIN 1450.[33][34]

In April 2018, the original logo was replaced with a stylized GO slanting right with trailing streamlines. However, the Gopher mascot remained the same.[35]

In August 2018, the Go principal contributors published two ″draft designs″ for new language features, Generics and Error Handling, and asked Go users to submit feedback on them.[36][37] Lack of support for generic programming and the verbosity of Error Handling in Go 1.x had drawn considerable criticism.
